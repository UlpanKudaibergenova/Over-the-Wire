Level Goal
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. 
The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

What is Setuid ?
Setuid is a Linux file permission setting that allows a user to execute the file or program with the permission of the owner of that file.
This is primarily used to elevate the privileges of the current user.

If a file is “setuid” and is owned by the user “root”, then a user that has the ability to execute that program, will do so as the user “root” instead of themselves.

The most common example of this in Linux is sudo. 
In this example, the user test located the executable sudo using which sudo & did a full listing of it with the ls -l /usr/bin/sudo command.
------------------------------------------------------------------
root@host [~]# id 
uid=1002(test) gid=1002(test) groups=1002(test)  
root@host [~]# which sudo 
/usr/bin/sudo  
root@host [~]# ls -l /usr/bin/sudo 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 136808 Jan 31 13:37 /usr/bin/sudo  
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you look at the permissions level of the sudo executable, you can see the s in the permissions for the user which normally would be an x.

Also, notice that this file is owned by the user root (the super-user) and that the file is executable by the world / other users (the last x in the permissions).
This indicates that when a user executes this program, the operating system will execute that file not as the user test, but as the user root.

In the matter of using the sudo command, this allows a normal user to perform elevated system functions WITHOUT having to log in as the root user.
