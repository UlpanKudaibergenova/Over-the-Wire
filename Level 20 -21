Level Goal
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument.
It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20).
If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think.

Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, nc, cat, bash, screen, tmux, Unix ‘job control’ (bg, fg, jobs, &, CTRL-Z, …)



[# Step 1]
>  ~ ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames
bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:

[# Step 2]
bandit20@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 12
-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit21 bandit20 12088 May  7 20:14 suconnect

[# Step 3]
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect
Usage: ./suconnect <portnumber>
This program will connect to the given port on localhost using TCP. If it receives the correct password from the other side, the next password is transmitted back.
[# Step 4]
bandit20@bandit:~$ nmap localhost
