Using Netcat (nc)

Netcat is a simple unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol.

In the simplest usage, nc <hostname> <port number> creates a TCP connection to the given port specified in <port number> on the given target host specified in <hostname>.

Your standard input is then sent to the host, and anything that comes back across the connection is sent to your standard output. This continues indefinitely, until the network side of the connection shuts down.

Using the following command, nc <hostname> <port number>. That is,
nc localhost 30000, we can either:

- Make connection to localhost on port 3000 â†’ Enter password
bandit14@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30000                                    # Make connection
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e                                         # Input password here!
Correct!

- Both (Make connection & Enter password)
bandit14@bandit:~$ 
echo "4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e" | nc localhost 30000              # OR
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | nc localhost 30000
Correct!
